# python-challenge

# These scripts were written to analyze the budget_data.csv and election_data.csv files

# The main.py file under the PyBank directory looped through each row of data in budget_data.csv and counted the 
# total number of months in the data, the sum of all the profits and losses over the entire period, the change from 
# one month to the next and then the average of those changes, and determined the greatest profit and greatest loss
# from one month to the next. This script then prints a formatted analysis both to the command line, where the script
# is executed, and in a text file. The results of this analysis can be see in the screenshot below.

# The main.py file under the PyPoll directory looped through each vote in election_data.csv and determined the total number of votes # the number of votes for each candiate, what percentage of total votes each candiate won, and determined a winner based on those 
# vote counts. The analysis was formatted and printed to the command line and to a text file. The results of this analysis can be 
# seen in the link to the screenshot below.
